// TODO set up the navigation

// TODO this screen will receive the gpx file path, split index, and optional strava token as props
// TODO load the file, do the split, and show stats for the two activities
// TODO stats include distance, avg speed, time, elevation gain
// TODO ideally also show graphs for each one
// TODO then a "share" button on each one to export to file or upload to strava directly
